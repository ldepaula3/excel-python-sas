# Make SAS call Python from within Microsoft Excel

## Overview

Can we run Python within SAS? How do I allow my team to choose their language of preference? How do I provide an interface that looks like Microsoft Excel, but has SAS functionalities?
This repo answers these questions.

I have written a [blog post](https://blogs.sas.com/content/sgf/2020/04/02/extending-excel-with-python-and-sas-viya/) with the step by step on how to stand-up this demo

## Steps

0. Setup a Python environment and [configure SAS](https://go.documentation.sas.com/doc/en/pgmsascdc/9.4_3.5/lecompobjref/p18qp136f91aaqn1h54v3b6pkant.htm)

1. Import data <br/>
    
2. Upload data to SAS <br/>
    
3. Define Python code <br/>

4. Define SAS code <br/>
